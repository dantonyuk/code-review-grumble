Notes of Grumpy Developer
=========================

Basically, these notes are based on my code review experience. I already
had some of them here and there, as personal notes, as code review
discussions, as face-to-face interaction. Some of them repeat again and
again, so I thought it would be nice to publish them. Just to ping with
a link to save time.

I'm going to share them gradually, one by one, I just don't want to
dump the whole pile on you at once. And it might be interesting. Maybe
not. We'll see.

Anyway nowadays, when we have to follow social distancing, no one can
get at me, so I'm not too scared, you know. Just kidding. Of course I'm
scared.
